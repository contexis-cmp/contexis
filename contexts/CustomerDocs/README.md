# CustomerDocs RAG System

A knowledge-based retrieval system generated with CMP Framework.

## Overview

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system provides:
- Semantic search across document collections
- Context-aware responses based on retrieved information
- Drift detection and consistency monitoring
- Scalable vector storage with sqlite

## Architecture

- **Context**: rag_agent.ctx - Defines search behavior and response rules
- **Memory**: Vector database with sentence-transformers embeddings
- **Prompts**: Templates for consistent response formatting
- **Tools**: Python implementation for semantic search
- **Tests**: Drift detection and quality assurance

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd tools/CustomerDocs
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add documents:**
   ```bash
   cp your-documents/* memory/CustomerDocs/documents/
   ```

3. **Test the system:**
   ```bash
   python tests/CustomerDocs/test_rag.py
   ```

4. **Run a query:**
   ```bash
   ctx run CustomerDocs "Your question here"
   ```

## Configuration

- **Database**: sqlite vector store
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers model
- **Chunk Size**: 700 tokens with 120 token overlap
- **Similarity Threshold**: 0.7

## Customization

- Modify contexts/CustomerDocs/rag_agent.ctx to adjust behavior
- Update prompts/CustomerDocs/search_response.md for response formatting
- Add custom tools in tools/CustomerDocs/
- Extend tests in tests/CustomerDocs/

## Monitoring

The system includes drift detection to monitor:
- Response consistency over time
- Search relevance and accuracy
- Performance metrics
- Business rule compliance
